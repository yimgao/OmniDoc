<html><body>## Project Overview<br>
<br>
This project aims to develop a simple and intuitive task management application (referred to as "TaskMaster") to help users organize and track their tasks efficiently. TaskMaster will provide a user-friendly interface for creating, prioritizing, assigning due dates, and marking tasks as complete. The application will be accessible via a web browser and designed to be used by individuals and small teams. The primary goal is to provide a straightforward alternative to complex project management software, focusing on core task management functionalities.<br>
<br>
## Core Features<br>
<br>
*   **Task Creation:**<br>
    *   Users should be able to easily create new tasks with a title, description, and optional due date.<br>
    *   Tasks should be able to be categorized using tags or labels.<br>
    *   Users should be able to assign tasks to themselves or other users (if team functionality is enabled).<br>
*   **Task Prioritization:**<br>
    *   Users should be able to assign a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low) to each task.<br>
    *   Tasks should be sortable by priority.<br>
*   **Due Date Management:**<br>
    *   Users should be able to set a due date for each task.<br>
    *   The application should display tasks approaching or past their due date prominently.<br>
    *   Optional: Send reminders to users about upcoming due dates.<br>
*   **Task Completion:**<br>
    *   Users should be able to mark tasks as complete.<br>
    *   Completed tasks should be moved to a separate "Completed" section or visually distinguished from active tasks.<br>
    *   Users should be able to view a history of completed tasks.<br>
*   **Task Filtering and Sorting:**<br>
    *   Users should be able to filter tasks based on various criteria (e.g., priority, due date, assignee, tag/label, status).<br>
    *   Users should be able to sort tasks based on various criteria (e.g., priority, due date, creation date).<br>
*   **User Authentication:**<br>
    *   Users should be able to create an account and log in securely.<br>
    *   Password reset functionality should be available.<br>
*   **Team Collaboration (Optional - Stretch Goal):**<br>
    *   Users should be able to create teams or groups.<br>
    *   Tasks can be assigned to team members.<br>
    *   Team members can view and update tasks assigned to the team.<br>
    *   Communication features (e.g., comments on tasks) can be added.<br>
<br>
## Technical Requirements<br>
<br>
*   **Platform:** Web-based application accessible via modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).<br>
*   **Technology Stack:**<br>
    *   Frontend: React or Vue.js for a responsive user interface.<br>
    *   Backend: Node.js with Express.js or Python with Django/Flask for API development.<br>
    *   Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for data storage.<br>
*   **Security:**<br>
    *   Secure password storage using hashing and salting.<br>
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).<br>
    *   Data encryption in transit (HTTPS).<br>
*   **Scalability:** The application should be designed to handle a growing number of users and tasks.<br>
*   **API:** A well-defined API should be available for future integrations.<br>
*   **Deployment:** The application should be deployable on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.<br>
*   **Responsiveness:** The user interface should be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).<br>
<br>
## User Personas<br>
<br>
*   **Individual User (Sarah):** A student or professional who needs a simple tool to organize their personal tasks, assignments, and appointments. Sarah values ease of use and wants to quickly add, prioritize, and track tasks. She is not interested in complex project management features. She needs reminders to keep her on track.<br>
*   **Small Team Leader (David):** A team leader who needs to assign tasks to team members and track their progress. David needs to see the status of all tasks assigned to his team and wants to ensure that deadlines are met. He needs a central place to manage tasks.<br>
*   **Freelancer (Emily):** A freelancer who manages multiple projects and needs to track tasks for each client. Emily needs to categorize tasks by project and track the time spent on each task. She needs to prioritize based on client deadlines.<br>
<br>
## Business Objectives<br>
<br>
*   **Acquire a user base of 1000 active users within the first 6 months.** This indicates successful adoption of the application.<br>
*   **Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5 based on user feedback and reviews.** This measures the quality and usability of the application.<br>
*   **Increase user engagement by having users log in at least 3 times per week.** This demonstrates the application's value in daily task management.<br>
*   **Reduce user churn by providing regular updates and improvements based on user feedback.** Continuous improvement is crucial for retaining users.<br>
*   **Generate revenue through a freemium model (optional), offering premium features for a subscription fee.** This can be a future objective for sustainability.<br>
<br>
## Constraints and Assumptions<br>
<br>
*   **Development Time:** The project must be completed within a 3-month timeframe.<br>
*   **Budget:** The development budget is limited to \$5,000.<br>
*   **Team Size:** The development team consists of 2 developers.<br>
*   **User Adoption:** It is assumed that users are familiar with basic task management concepts.<br>
*   **Third-Party Integrations:** Initial development will not include integrations with other applications (e.g., calendars, email). These can be considered in future iterations.<br>
*   **Scope:** The initial scope is limited to core task management features. Advanced features like time tracking, Gantt charts, and resource management are excluded.<br>
*   **Hosting:** Hosting costs are not included in the initial budget and will be addressed separately.<br>
*   **Availability:** The application will be available 24/7 with an expected uptime of 99%.<br>
