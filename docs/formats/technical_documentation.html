<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The "SmartJobTracking" project aims to develop a comprehensive job application tracking system. This system will allow users to efficiently manage their job search process, from initial application to offer negotiation. The system will provide features for organizing job postings, tracking application statuses, setting reminders, and analyzing job search performance. The goal is to streamline the job search process and improve the user's chances of landing their desired job.</p>
<h2>Core Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Job Posting Management:</strong><ul>
<li>Ability to add job postings with relevant details (job title, company, location, salary range, application date, job description, link to the posting).</li>
<li>Categorize and tag job postings (e.g., by industry, role, company size).</li>
<li>Import job postings from various job boards using a browser extension or API integration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Application Tracking:</strong><ul>
<li>Track the status of each application (e.g., Applied, Phone Screen, Interview, Offer, Rejected).</li>
<li>Record the date of each application status update.</li>
<li>Set reminders for follow-up actions (e.g., sending a thank-you note, checking in with the recruiter).</li>
<li>Log communication with the company (e.g., emails, phone calls, interview notes).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Progress Visualization &amp; Analytics:</strong><ul>
<li>Visualize the job search progress with charts and graphs (e.g., number of applications, interview conversion rate, time spent on each stage).</li>
<li>Generate reports on job search performance (e.g., average time to get an interview, success rate by industry).</li>
<li>Provide insights and recommendations based on the user's job search data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Resume &amp; Cover Letter Management:</strong><ul>
<li>Store and manage multiple versions of resumes and cover letters.</li>
<li>Associate specific resumes and cover letters with individual job applications.</li>
<li>Track which resume and cover letter versions are performing best.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Integration with Job Boards and LinkedIn:</strong><ul>
<li>Directly apply to jobs from within the SmartJobTracking system (via API integration).</li>
<li>Import profile information from LinkedIn to pre-populate application forms.</li>
<li>Automatically update application statuses based on information from LinkedIn.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Assign due dates and priorities to tasks.</li>
<li>Receive reminders for upcoming tasks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>Database:</strong> Relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) to store job postings, application data, and user information. Scalability should be considered.</li>
<li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Python (with frameworks like Django or Flask) or Node.js (with frameworks like Express.js) for backend development. React, Angular, or Vue.js for frontend development.</li>
<li><strong>API Integrations:</strong>  Integrate with popular job boards (e.g., Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor), email providers (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), and calendar applications (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar).</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Secure user authentication and authorization. Data encryption at rest and in transit. Regular security audits and penetration testing. Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).</li>
<li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Cloud-based hosting platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for scalability and reliability.</li>
<li><strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> Support for modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> The application should load quickly and be responsive to user interactions.  Implement caching strategies to improve performance.</li>
